        <h1>Damocles</h1>
        <img src="Damocles.png" alt="Damocles"/>
        <p>I grew up in a family of adventurers, Dad was always out and about on a contract or something of the like, Mom was always repairing his armor and weapons that were usually in tatters, while somehow keeping the house clean and food prepared while my sister and I helped out wherever we could, sometimes Dad would even give us fighting lessons and the like, "It'll keep us strong and ready," I never understood what he meant, but I was just a child. We were in a quiet village on the outskirts of civilization, there were dangers, your occasional necromancer trying to raise an army or a bandit warband attempting to take hold of the village. No matter how hard those who wished us harm would try, seemingly when things were at their worst, shining armor, as bright as the sun, men and women as tall as buildings, wielding various talismans and weapons, would come thundering into the fray with little to no regard for themselves, they were Paladins of Devotion, with Clerics in tow. They were heroes, helping those in need, fighting back the evils of the night, I felt nothing but love and adoration for them. The adoration that I felt stayed with me until I was of age to swear an Oath, I chose the Oath of Devotion, unknowingly they all worshipped and served Vestyr, this was new to me, he seemed to be a god of righteousness so I figured I would give it a shot, although I never took too much to worship. I knew that I could make the world a better place. I left home and was headed off to training, wish that I could say Caer Bronach was a pleasant stay, however it was not. For the first several months were subjected to "Tranquility", starved of food and contact, we were made to pray to Vestyr every moment of every day, for several months, it was said that when nothing was left, Vestyr would smile upon us and that he would mold and shape us into beings of pure light and justice, I try to block out that period of time from my memory. When the time came for us to be trained physically as well as the arcane arts, I excelled in training, we were trained in basic spell and incantation casting and depending on combat prowess or some other intangible quality we were sorted. Some went to Clerics of varying domains and others were sent to be made Paladins, due to my father's ragtag training I was made a paladin. Many years went by, I saw many come and go yet I remained, I wondered why, why wasn't I fighting on the fronts, saving folk from all over the realm, it turns out I was made a mentor, and I didn't realize it, I always wondered why recruits would follow me around like clueless pups, it was almost as if I had a tail. Day in and day out I would go through the motions, imparting knowledge upon these eager souls, they were like sponges, I always thought to myself "so this is what my father felt like." There was this one recruit, a Goliath, Chadmael, incredibly talented in combat, a penchant for dual wielding, he fought with reckless abandon, but did it well. I took him under my wing, as a protege, which we weren't supposed to do, but there was real potential in this kid. I taught him war tactics, but he was terrible at spellcasting so I usually left him in the care of Clerics so that they would round him out. He would be the perfect Paladin, he would be the best of us. He spoke of his father, it was odd, there was a twinkle in his eye whenever he did. I also noticed that when he spoke of the god's there was no reverence, no grandstanding, as if they were people just like us. I found it important that he understood the reality of our lives, we read the after-action reports, which usually recruits didn't have access to. The reports recounted the tactics used, spells put into place and any possible sigils or wards seen, as well as casualties. Weeks passed and his training continued, but one day when I went to his barracks for our daily sparring, he wasn't there, I asked around, but found no answers, only more questions he was simply gone, I wonder what ever happened to that kid. One night I came upon a group of scrolls baring a seal of an eye, pressed into red wax. I remembered Knight Commander "Redwall", (called this due to the red band around the eye slits of his helm) told me that these should never be seen by any eyes beside his, but curiosity got the better of me. They spoke of inquisitions, ordered assassinations of other paladins and clerics, members of clergy, there were horrible things, entire villages being "judged" and found "unholy". There were mounds of these scrolls, all detailing events I couldn't imagine happening in my worst nightmares, but the casualty reports confirmed these. Surely these had to be code, meant to frighten those reading them, surely this was some illusion, I had to know, but I stopped reading them when I awoke to my quarter's door slightly ajar, with a note in the crook of the door, "Those who seek forbidden knowledge, peer into the darkness, wandering into it, not knowing, while they are blind, they still are watched." I stopped reading the reports immediately, from that day on, I kept eyes in the back of my head and never looked at my brothers and sisters the same. Seemingly almost made to distract me, a new training structure was ordered, it was decreed that one Paladin and one Cleric would train recruits, it was said to produce a more "well-rounded" trainee and so the fateful day came that I would be assigned a "partner". As I was instructing reaction casting, I smelled something wrong, sensed it even before that, hellfire, something evil was near, I forced my trainees behind myself and told them to scatter, then she rounded the corner, would-be Clerics in tow. A Tiefling, the exact opposite of what I was, a creature of hell, surely this couldn't be my new partner. An outstretched red hand reached out to me, a voice followed, "You must be Damocles, name's Zuri, nice to meet you, better to meet me i'm sure." Surprisingly enough, we got along swimmingly, before I knew it we were spending late nights and early mornings in each other's company, deducing new battle tactics and reviewing contact reports from the roaming bands of Paladins. Before I knew it our time together grew and so did our relationship, we spoke of our dreams, she said she wanted nothing more than to study the "Old Magic" at Antalen and I swore to her that I would tear a rift in space and time to get her there, she laughed, of course she did, it was ridiculous, but every night I prayed for her dream to come true. However, all things must end, she was selected to be transferred, she received an order dictating that she report to her very dream, Antalen, apparently they were in need of a Death Domain Cleric. With this news, came the realization that she would be leaving and that I would be stuck here. She asked what she should do, I said that I would never forgive her if she didn't follow her dream, destiny waited for no one and that I would always love her and that one day, we would reunite. I saw her to her carriage on that day and within that very same moment, I lost part of myself. Days after she left, I received on order, directly handed from "Redwall" himself, that I would return once again to my village to provide assistance in an ongoing investigation. When I arrived at the basecamp, I was given orders to take a small squad on patrol directed around the outskirts of town, this was fine, patrols lasted only a short bit, soon I would see my mother and father, odds are sister had gone off on her own by now, she was a trailblazer when we were kids I doubt that changed now. The time for the patrol had come, the fog was thick and the air tasted stale, almost rotten, I turned to my patrol to confer with them and was met with a vast expanse of swamps, no sight of them, I stopped and saw nothing around, no traces of a struggle, if they had tracks, something or someone had covered them, just then I felt as though the sun had slammed me in the back, then nothing. When I awoke, the pain in my back was still there, it burned, not like fire, almost, a holy smite, no.. it couldn't be, no, I must be mistaken. I wondered why I wasn't dead and just as I asked this question, the air grew from a stale, stagnant feel, to a freezing cold, it burned like fire in my lungs, just ahead I saw a figure, cloaked in black, with a face I couldn't see, it pointed away from itself toward the village. I tried to scream out for help, but my voice was not my own, out came a rasp, not of my own creation, but it came from my carapace, "RUN." The air once again grew stale, the smite no longer stung, but there was a new element to this cocktail of horror, I smelt smoke, something was wrong. I ran, ribs cracking with every pump of my arm, something was horribly wrong, why was this happening, why, there must be an explanation, surely the others would know. I broke through the fog and was met with a visage of smoke, fire and brimstone, my village, my family's village, my friend's village, burning like a dying star, I wanted to scream or cry, but there was no time, I ran into the flames. My skin should have cracked and burst, I should have died, but these flames seemed to almost be repulsed by me. Our home was toward the back, I had to get there, I couldn't hesitate, bodies littered the streets, spears in their backs, their throats were slit, but their hands were tied, there must be a reason. Then I came upon it, my worst fears realized, the Banner of Devotion planted in my mother's back, my father, a forehead branded with the eye, throat slit, both of them seemingly staring into each other's eyes, in love, even unto the cusp of oblivion. The once shining armor had become a stained red, marred with scuffs, a legion of these bastards & demons, charlatans of faith stood before me, men and women I once called comrades, had betrayed me, did our oaths mean nothing? If we don't honor what we stand for than what were we, no, it was no longer we, it was them. "He wasn't supposed to see this, however, he's been tainted as well, this charade had gone on long enough." I wanted to plead, I wanted to ask them why, I wanted to curse them for eternity, I wanted to curse the gods. I wanted to run to my mother and father's bodies to attempt to bring them back. Next, a scream, no, not a scream, a scream denotes fear, just as before it wasn't me that produced it, yet it came from my carapace, it was a roar of pure anguish, hatred, sadness, and rage. The last thing I remember was my blood feeling like it froze. I awoke to ashes, but not smoke, it was spring when I left on patrol, yet it was snowing. As I tried to lift myself from this earthly tomb I was met with resistance, several spears right through my back, pinning me to the ground, yet they all seemed to turn to ash moments later. Was I dead, was this it? I looked toward the place I once called home, it was a ruin, the corpses of my mother and father, reduced to bones. Then I saw them again, the figure, cloaked in black, but it wasn't cloth, it was almost made of the air itself, it flowed in a manner not of this realm. I once again attempted to ask a question but could not muster the words, but once again, words that were not my own emitted from my mouth, "You seek vengeance Aasimar, for those you love and lost, I will grant you this, but in return you must give up that which you hold most dear, do you accept." "YES." "Very well my child, I will be watching." And so I set off to find a world that I no longer recognized, beasts roamed the landscape that I could never imagine existing, ripples in space and time, tears in reality itself. It would take time to find those that had betrayed me, but I was no longer bound by Oath. This "oath" meant nothing to me anymore, they took everything I loved from me, they took the love and happiness from my life, ripped my heart from my chest, then plunged a dagger of betrayal into my back, they would suffer, they will all suffer, I will see their order crumble to dust, forgotten to the unforgiving wastes of eternity and as I stand on the mountain of their corpses, I will once again ask them of their Oath and what it means to them now. The Gods they serve had turned ignored the cries of the innocent, now I will see if they hear their disciples cries of death. The wind, it whispers to me, "The answers lie in Zenith".</p>
