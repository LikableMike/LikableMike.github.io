			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<h2>Snake Clone</h2>
				<video width="550px" controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid cyan">
					<source src="SnakeVideo.webm" type="video/webm"/>
				</video>
				<p id="bio">This is one of my most recent projects. The Snake clone was built using Android Studio and had a strong focus on 2D 
					computer graphics. I used my previous object oriented programming skills and newly aquired design pattern skills to build a 
					revamped version of the classic game Snake including new food effects, sound effects and music, and an entirely new custom look.</p>
			<div style="display: inline-block;">
				<h2>Local Multiplayer Unix Terminal Game</h2>
				<video width="550px"  controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid cyan">
					<source src="TerminalGameVid.webm" type="video/webm"/>
				  </video>
				<p id="bio">This is my Assembly turnbased multiplayer game that allows for up to 10 players with three different classes with unique attacks
					 and health. This class had a huge focus on Computer register manipulation with moving values around to compare and receive user input.
					  I learned the true way that the fundamental loops and other statements work behind the scenes and used these to create a functioning 
					  game with input validation and randomness.</p>

			<h2>Java Player Movement and Interaction Project</h2>
			<video width="550px" controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid cyan">
				<source src="Java2DGameVid.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
			</video>
			<p id="bio">This was a collaboration project between the Professor and the student. Our professor provided a "Bare bones" game engine that he wrote and 
				we were in charge of adding programmer art along with player movement and object collision/ interaction.</p>
				
			<h2 style="margin-top: 250px;">Pokemon Terminal Game</h2>
				<video width="550px" controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid cyan">
					<source src="PokemonVideo.webm" type="video/webm"/>
				</video>
				<p id="bio">This was the first Programming project I did for my intro computer science class at my Junior College.
					 We were able to create our own project to display what we had learned throughout the class and I chose to make a turn based Pokemon battle clone 
					 where you are put against computer controlled teams that increase in strength and difficulty as you play eventually leading to a main boss.
