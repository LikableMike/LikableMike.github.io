			<h2>Tectonic Tactics</h2>
			<img src="Video.png" width="400" height="300" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid white">	
				<p id="bio">I am currently leading the development of Tectonic Tactics, a PC/Mobile game using Godot, where I am responsible for implementing core gameplay
					 features, developing front-end UI, and architecting server infrastructure for multiplayer functionality. I work closely with a team of designers,
					  artists, and marketers, and I contribute to the entire game development process—from gameplay mechanics to optimizing the development pipeline for 
					  artists and designers. I ensure smooth gameplay and performance by actively identifying and resolving bugs, while maintaining a high-quality experience
					   for both single-player and multiplayer modes.<br><br><br>

			<h2>Tonne It Up - Mobile Fitness App</h2>

					<source src="TonneItUpDemo.MP4" type="video/mp4"/>
				</video>
				<p id="bio">As Tech Lead for the “Tonne It Up” fitness app, developed for iOS and Android using Flutter, I led a team of 7 fellow university students to create a platform connecting 
					personal trainers with clients for tracking fitness progress, managing appointments, and creating personalized workout plans. I designed and implemented key features, 
					integrated Firebase for cloud storage to manage user data, and ensured seamless deployment for mobile testing and release. My role also involved overseeing the 
					development process, coordinating with team members, and ensuring the app met functionality and performance goals. <br><br><br>

			<h2>Growth - GMTK 2024</h2>
				<video width="550px" controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid white">
					<source src="GrowthGameplay.webm" type="video/webm"/>
				</video>
				<p id="bio">Growth is a 2D platformer created for the GMTK 2024 Game Jam, built around the theme "Built to Scale." I developed the game in Godot, allowing players to 
					control the size of their character to navigate increasingly challenging platforming puzzles. The game was designed and implemented within a short time frame, 
					showcasing my skills in rapid prototyping and gameplay design. A playable version is available online, and I encourage feedback to further refine the experience. <br><br><br>

			<h2>Untitled Godot Game - (In Progress 6/24/2024)</h2>
				<video width="550px" controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid white">
					<source src="PixelWizard_6-24-24.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
				</video>
				<p id="bio">Now that its summer and I have some more free time I'm looking into Godot after all the recent talks about it. After watching a youtube video 
					by Acerola, I mainly wanted to try out quantization and dithering to make a pixel art style game from a free 3d asset pack by Kay Lousberg. I think its looking 
					pretty cool so far, especially with the mix of dynamic lighting so I think I'm going to try to make a "Game Jam" style isometric rogue like just for fun. Most recent 
					update added two more spell effects that I can rotate through. I also added a simple skeleton enemy that wanders around until the player gets within range then
					it starts to chase the player. Also did some refining to the visuals and the player animation.
					After just finishing my Advanced Graphics course I'm stepping further into the world of shaders so expect to see small updates to this project with 
					graphic effects that I think look really cool in this tiny game. <br><br><br>

			<h2>Beyond - 3D Java Multiplayer Game</h2>
				<video width="550px" controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid white">
					<source src="BeyondShowcase.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
				</video>
				<p id="bio">This project was for my Computer Game Architecture class where we learned the structure of game engines and how to modify them 
					to fit our needs. Instead of using professional game engines like Unity our professor had created a very minimal game engine in java which
					forced us to get our hands dirty and build upon it to add features we wanted. I took this course along side an Advanced Computer
					 Graphics course so I was also able to incorperate what I hade learned in that class 
					to enhance the visuals by modifying the shader pipeline. This project taught me about different camera controllers, scenegraphs, and how to build game worlds
					with textures and skyboxes among other things. In my game I largely focused on the physics aspect as I found it very interesting but also enjoyed building the 
					NPC's and networking allowing for multiplayer. For more information and a deeper description of the game itself check out my GitHub.

			<h2>Snake Clone</h2>
				<video width="550px" controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid white">
					<source src="SnakeVideo.webm" type="video/webm"/>
				</video>
				<p id="bio">This is one of my most recent projects. The Snake clone was built using Android Studio and had a strong focus on 2D 
					computer graphics. I used my previous object oriented programming skills and newly aquired design pattern skills to build a 
					revamped version of the classic game Snake including new food effects, sound effects and music, and an entirely new custom look.</p>

				<h2>Local Multiplayer Unix Terminal Game</h2>
				<video width="550px"  controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid white">
					<source src="TerminalGameVid.webm" type="video/webm"/>
				  </video>
				<p id="bio">This is my Assembly turnbased multiplayer game that allows for up to 10 players with three different classes with unique attacks
					 and health. This class had a huge focus on Computer register manipulation with moving values around to compare and receive user input.
					  I learned the true way that the fundamental loops and other statements work behind the scenes and used these to create a functioning 
					  game with input validation and randomness.</p>

			<h2>Java Player Movement and Interaction Project</h2>
			<video width="550px" controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid white">
				<source src="Java2DGameVid.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
			</video>
			<p id="bio">This was a collaboration project between the Professor and the student. Our professor provided a "Bare bones" game engine that he wrote and 
				we were in charge of adding programmer art along with player movement and object collision/ interaction.</p>
				
			<h2 style="margin-top: 250px;">Pokemon Terminal Game</h2>
				<video width="550px" controls="controls" style="float: right; margin-right: 5%; border: 4px solid white">
					<source src="PokemonVideo.webm" type="video/webm"/>
				</video>
				<p id="bio">This was the first Programming project I did for my intro computer science class at my Junior College.
					 We were able to create our own project to display what we had learned throughout the class and I chose to make a turn based Pokemon battle clone 
					 where you are put against computer controlled teams that increase in strength and difficulty as you play eventually leading to a main boss.
