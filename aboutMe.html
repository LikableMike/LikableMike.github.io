				<p>I am originally from Dublin California and after attending Las Positas
				community college, I transfered to CSUS to pursue my bachelors degree in 
				Computer Science. I was first introduced to programming in a high school
				Introduction to Engineering course but didn't fully pursue it until my second year 
			    of college. Since Then I have been hooked and am always looking for 
			    more things to learn to improve my skills. I am a man of many <a href="Hobbies.html" class="link">hobbies</a> and when 
			    I'm not in front of a computer you can find me at the nearest pool table, 
			    knee deep in a new art project, or running my Dungeons and Dragons campaign for 
			    some friends. </p>
